Enhancing Car Recommendations with AI

Excited to share my latest project‚Äîa TF-IDF-based car recommendation system powered by **cosine similarity**. The model processes diverse car features (e.g., name, price, engine capacity) and matches them with user preferences to deliver accurate recommendations. Here's a sneak peek into the workflow and performance with two datasets, achieving up to **76.55% average similarity accuracy.
